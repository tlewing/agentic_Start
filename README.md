# Agentic

**Build your startup with AI agents instead of employees.**

You're one person. But when you clone this repo and type `claude`, you have a team: product managers, designers, engineers, QA, security, DevOps—14 specialists ready to build whatever you're building.

No hiring. No managing. No payroll. Just building.

## What Happens

```
~/projects $ git clone https://github.com/jasonhoffman/agentic ~/.agentic
~/projects $ cd ~/.agentic
~/projects/.agentic $ claude
```

```
Welcome to Agentic.

I'm your Chief of Staff. I'll help you build your company with AI agents.

What are you building?
```

You describe your idea. The Chief of Staff helps you set up your project, define your vision, make technology choices. When it's time to build, they bring in specialists:

```
You: I need the user authentication built

Chief of Staff: Let me bring in the Backend Engineer.

Backend Engineer: I'll design the auth flow. Looking at your stack...
[builds the API, writes tests, documents the endpoints]

Backend Engineer: Auth API complete. Ready for frontend.

Chief of Staff: Bringing in the Frontend Engineer.

Frontend Engineer: I see the API is ready. Building the login screens...
[builds the UI, connects to API, handles errors]

Frontend Engineer: Login flow complete.

Chief of Staff: Ready for QA?
```

One conversation. Multiple specialists. You make decisions. They do the work.

Your entire vocabulary:

| Say | Get |
|-----|-----|
| `today` | Morning briefing. What needs your attention. |
| `status` | Where everything stands right now. |
