**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** For Approval

## Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified

**Skill Level Sets (80 current → 15 proposed):**
- Typos: "Skils" vs "Skills", "NFPA 7OE" vs "NFPA 70E", "Lean Stalls" vs "Lean Skills"
- Fragmentation: Leadership split across 12+ sets
- Inconsistency: Some are topics, some are skill types
- Default bucket: 16 skills with no proper classification

**Skills (260 current):**
- Duplicates: Multiple versions of same skill
- Inconsistent naming: "Return Service to" (incomplete)
- Orphaned skills: Skills with no clear Skill Level Set
- Over-granular: Too many micro-skills

**Categories (163 current):**
- Inconsistent capitalization: "safety" vs "Safety"
- Typos: "Tear Management" vs "Team Management"
- Too granular: 163 categories for 260 skills
- No hierarchy: Flat list with no structure
