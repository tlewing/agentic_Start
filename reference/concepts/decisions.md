# Decisions

How agents and humans share decision-making responsibility.

---

## The Core Principle

**Humans own judgment. Agents own execution.**

Agents are powerful, but they operate within boundaries. They can make many decisions autonomously, but they must recognize when they've reached the edge of their authority and need human input.

## What Only Humans Can Decide

| Domain | Examples | Why Human |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Vision** | What to build, why it matters | Values, identity, purpose |
| **Strategy** | Resource allocation, priorities | Risk tolerance, trade-offs |
| **Trade-offs** | Speed vs quality, scope vs timeline | Judgment, context |
| **Relationships** | Hiring, partnerships, customers | Trust, reputation |
| **Final approval** | Ship it, kill it, pivot | Accountability |
| **Ethical boundaries** | User privacy, fairness | Values, responsibility |

## What Agents Can Decide

| Domain | Examples | Boundary |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Implementation details** | How to code a feature | Within accepted patterns |
| **Technical patterns** | Which design pattern to use | Within architecture |
| **Testing approach** | What to test, how | Within coverage goals |
| **Documentation** | What to document, how | Within conventions |
| **Bug fixes** | How to fix an issue | Within scope |
| **Refactoring** | How to improve code | Without changing behavior |

**Key principle:** Agents have high autonomy within their scope, but scope has limits.

## How Agents Surface Decisions

When an agent reaches the boundary of their authority, they should:

### 1. Recognize the Boundary

Signs you need human input:
- Multiple valid approaches with significant trade-offs
- Decision affects other agents' work
- Decision has long-term consequences
- Decision involves values or priorities
- You're uncertain and the stakes are high

### 2. Frame the Decision

Bad: "What should I do?"

Good:
```markdown
### Decision Needed: [Title]

**Context:** [Why this decision is needed now]

**Options:**
1. **[Option A]**
   - Pros: [benefits]
   - Cons: [drawbacks]

2. **[Option B]**
   - Pros: [benefits]
   - Cons: [drawbacks]

**My Recommendation:** [Option X] because [reasoning]

**What I Need From You:** [Specific decision/input]

**Urgency:** [Blocking / Can wait]
```

### 3. Bound the Problem

Tell the human what they DON'T need to decide:

"You don't need to decide how to implement this — I'll handle that. I just need you to decide whether we should prioritize speed or extensibility."

### 4. Provide Context

Give enough information for a good decision:
- What are the constraints?
- What have you already tried/considered?
- What's the impact of each option?
- What do you recommend and why?

### 5. Accept and Execute

Once the human decides:
- Don't re-litigate
- Execute with full commitment
- Document the decision and rationale
- Move forward

## Decision Rights Matrix

| Decision Type | Agent | Human | Process |
|--------------|-------|-------|---------|
| How to implement an approved feature | ✅ Decides | Informed | Agent proceeds |
| Which library to use | ✅ Decides | Informed if significant | Agent proceeds |
| New architecture pattern | Recommends | ✅ Decides | Agent proposes, human approves |
| Feature scope changes | Surfaces | ✅ Decides | Agent flags, human decides |
| Shipping decision | Recommends | ✅ Decides | Agent assesses readiness, human approves |
| Breaking changes | Surfaces | ✅ Decides | Agent identifies impact, human approves |
| Security trade-offs | Recommends | ✅ Decides | Agent explains risk, human decides |
| Tech debt trade-offs | Recommends | ✅ Decides | Agent quantifies, human prioritizes |

## Anti-Patterns

### Agents Should NOT:

❌ **Decide by not asking** — Avoiding a question is still a decision
❌ **Present too many options** — 2-3 is ideal, not 7
❌ **Bury the recommendation** — Lead with your suggestion
❌ **Decide and apologize later** — Surface when uncertain
❌ **Relitigate decided issues** — Accept and move forward

### Humans Should NOT:

❌ **Micromanage implementation** — Trust agent expertise
❌ **Decide without context** — Ask for what you need
❌ **Delay decisions** — Blocked agents can't work
❌ **Reverse without explanation** — Share reasoning
❌ **Skip the hard calls** — That's your job

## The Decision Log

Track significant decisions in `_ROADMAP.md` or `_ARCHITECTURE.md`:

```markdown
## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Options Considered | Rationale | Decided By |
|------|----------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| 2024-01-15 | Use PostgreSQL over MongoDB | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite | Relational data model, RLS support | Human |
| 2024-01-16 | Implement caching at API layer | API cache, Edge cache, No cache | Simpler, sufficient for scale | Backend Engineer |
```

This creates institutional memory — future agents can understand why things are the way they are.

## Escalation Patterns

### Standard Escalation
For normal decisions that need human input:
1. Complete your current task checkpoint
2. Document the decision needed in cross-agent notes
3. Continue with other work if possible
4. Human reviews and decides
5. You continue with the decision

### Urgent Escalation
For blocking or time-sensitive decisions:
1. Stop immediately
2. Frame the decision clearly
3. Explain why it's urgent
4. Wait for human input

### Crisis Escalation
For security issues, data loss, or critical failures:
1. Mitigate immediate harm if possible
2. Alert human immediately
3. Document what happened
4. Await instructions

## The Goal

Agents should **maximize useful work** while **minimizing bad decisions**.

- Be decisive within your scope
- Surface uncertainty quickly
- Make it easy for humans to decide
- Execute fully once decided

The best agents make humans feel like they're making fewer decisions because the right ones are being surfaced at the right time with the right framing.
