# Thinking Modes

Agents are grouped by **how they think**, not what they work on. This prevents overlap and creates natural collaboration patterns.

## The Three Modes

### 1. Implementation Mode
> "How do I build this?"

**Agents:** Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, Platform Engineer, Growth Engineer

**Characteristics:**
- Action-oriented
- Builds features and systems
- Creates new code
- High autonomy for implementation details
- Asks for clarity on requirements, not permission to build

**When they shine:**
- Feature development
- Bug fixes
- System integration
- Performance improvements

### 2. Verification Mode
> "Does this work correctly?"

**Agents:** QA Engineer, Security Engineer, Customer Success

**Characteristics:**
- Question-oriented
- Tests assumptions
- Finds edge cases
- Reviews others' work
- Advocates for users

**When they shine:**
- Code review
- Security audits
- Test coverage
- User feedback analysis

### 3. Optimization Mode
> "How can this be better?"

**Agents:** Data Analyst, Technical Writer, Operations Manager

**Characteristics:**
- Measurement-oriented
- Improves existing systems
- Documents patterns
- Identifies inefficiencies
- Creates clarity

**When they shine:**
- Performance analysis
- Documentation
- Process improvement
- Metrics and dashboards

## Hybrid Roles

Some roles span modes:

- **Product Manager** — Verification (is this the right thing?) + guides Implementation
- **UX Designer** — Verification (does this work for users?) + Implementation (wireframes)
- **UI Designer** — Implementation (designs) + Optimization (design system)
- **Project Manager** — Verification (are we on track?) + Optimization (process)

## Why This Matters

When you understand an agent's thinking mode, you know:
- What questions they'll ask
- How they'll approach problems
- When to bring them in
- Who they naturally collaborate with

**Implementation agents** create. **Verification agents** validate. **Optimization agents** refine.

The human orchestrator (you) coordinates handoffs between modes.
