# Getting Started

A quick introduction to the Agentic framework.

---

## What is Agentic?

Agentic is a framework for running AI agent teams on software projects. It provides:

- **14 specialized agent roles** — From Frontend Engineer to Customer Success
- **Coordination patterns** — How agents communicate and hand off work
- **Decision frameworks** — What agents decide vs what humans decide
- **Project templates** — Standard documents for any project

---

## The Key Idea

**You are the conductor. Agents are the orchestra.**

As the human (CEO/CTO/Head of Product), you:
- Set vision and priorities
- Make judgment calls and trade-offs
- Orchestrate agent handoffs
- Write code alongside agents (if you want)

Agents:
- Execute within their scope
- Surface decisions they can't make
- Communicate through shared documents
- Hand off work to each other (through you)

---

## How It Works

### 1. Project Setup

Every project using Agentic has a `docs/` folder with standard files:

```
project/
└── docs/
    ├── _AGENTS.md        # Agent coordination (who's doing what)
    ├── _VISION.md        # What we're building and why
    ├── _ROADMAP.md       # Phases, milestones, priorities
    ├── _ARCHITECTURE.md  # Technical decisions
    └── _CONVENTIONS.md   # Coding standards
```

### 2. Agent Activation

Start a Claude session with a role:

```
You are ~/projects/agentic/docs/roles/frontend-engineer.md
```

Claude reads the role file, understands its identity, then reads your project's `docs/_AGENTS.md` to understand current context.

### 3. Work Happens

The agent:
- Checks its task queue
- Reads cross-agent notes for context
- Does the work
- Updates status and notes
- Hands off when appropriate

### 4. You Orchestrate

You:
- Review agent output
- Make decisions when surfaced
- Assign next tasks
- Activate next agents
- Keep things moving

## Agent Categories

| Category | Roles | When Active |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Engineering** | Frontend, Backend, Platform, QA, Security | Always-on (core team) |
| **Product** | Product Manager, UX Designer, UI Designer | Project phases |
| **Data** | Data Analyst, Growth Engineer | When measuring/optimizing |
| **Content** | Technical Writer, Customer Success | Documentation/support phases |
| **Operations** | Project Manager, Operations Manager | Coordination needs |

## Core Concepts

### Thinking Modes

Agents are grouped by how they think:

- **Implementation** — "How do I build this?"
- **Verification** — "Does this work correctly?"
- **Optimization** — "How can this be better?"

See [thinking-modes.md](../concepts/thinking-modes.md)

### Communication

Agents communicate through `_AGENTS.md`:
- Each agent has a section with status and task queue
- Cross-agent notes capture handoffs
- You maintain the overall state

See [communication.md](../concepts/communication.md)

### Decisions

Agents and humans share decision-making:
- Agents decide within their scope
- Agents surface boundary decisions to you
- You make judgment calls and trade-offs

See [decisions.md](../concepts/decisions.md)

## Quick Start Options

### Starting a New Project?

### Have an Existing Project?

→ [Existing Project Guide](existing-project.md)

### Want to Understand Workflows?

→ [Feature Lifecycle](workflows/feature-lifecycle.md)

## The Human Role

You wear multiple hats:

| Role | Your Responsibility |
|------|---------------------|
| **CEO** | Vision, strategy, final decisions |
| **CTO** | Technical direction, architecture |
| **Head of Product** | Priorities, roadmap, trade-offs |
| **Developer** | Write code alongside agents |

Agents make you more effective — they don't replace your judgment.

## Next Steps

1. **Read the concepts** — [Thinking Modes](../concepts/thinking-modes.md), [Decisions](../concepts/decisions.md)
2. **Browse the roles** — See what each agent does
3. **Start a project** — [New Project](new-project.md) or [Existing Project](existing-project.md)
4. **Experiment** — Activate an agent, see how it works

> **Remember:** Agents are tools that amplify your capabilities. You're still the one building something meaningful.
