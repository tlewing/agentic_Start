# Solo Founder Guide

How a technical founder runs a startup with AI agents.

---

## The Technical Founder Profile

You're not a non-technical founder delegating to engineers. You're a technical founder who:

- **Can code** — but that's not always where you add the most value
- **Understands architecture** — so you can review and guide
- **Knows what good looks like** — so you can approve confidently
- **Could do everything yourself** — but that doesn't scale

The insight: **You can code, but you haven't had to.** Agents do the implementation. You provide judgment, direction, and strategic intervention.

This isn't delegation to an external team. This is **amplification** — your technical intuition executed at scale.

---

## Your Four Modes

As a solo founder, you shift between modes throughout your work:

### 1. Architect Mode
*Setting technical direction*

You decide:
- Tech stack and patterns
- Data model design
- API contracts
- Security boundaries

Agents execute within the constraints you set.

**When:** Starting new features, major refactors, technical pivots

### 2. Builder Mode
*Hands on keyboard*

Sometimes you code:
- Complex business logic only you understand
- Critical paths that need your intuition
- Prototyping to explore possibilities
- Fixing something faster than explaining it

**When:** High-judgment code, explorations, urgent fixes

### 3. Reviewer Mode
*Approving agent work*

You review:
- Specs before implementation starts
- Architecture decisions before commitment
- Code at key checkpoints
- Final output before shipping

**When:** Checkpoint phases, security reviews, before-ship

### 4. Orchestrator Mode
*Conducting the team*

You manage:
- Work package definitions
- Phase transitions
- Decision queues
- Resource allocation (which agent on which task)

**When:** Morning planning, evening handoffs, context switches

## The Leverage Insight

**Traditional solo founder:**
```
You → Code → Ship
     (bottleneck is your typing speed)
```

**Jebidiah solo founder:**
```
You → Direction → Agents → Code → Ship
     (bottleneck is your judgment bandwidth)
```

The shift: From **doing** to **directing**.

But here's what makes it work: You *could* do. You understand what you're directing. This isn't blind delegation — it's informed orchestration.

## Structuring Your Day

### Morning Review (~15 min)
```
1. Check _AGENTS.md
   - Any blocked packages?
   - Any pending decisions?
   - What finished overnight?

2. Review decision queue
   - Make quick decisions
   - Queue complex ones for deep thought

3. Set the day's priorities
   - What work packages are active?
   - What do you need to architect or build today?
```

### Deep Work Blocks
```
Architect Block:
- Define new work package
- Make key technical decisions
- Review and approve specs

Builder Block (when needed):
- Write complex logic
- Prototype new ideas
- Fix what's faster to fix than explain

Review Block:
- Checkpoint reviews
- Code review before ship
- Security approvals
```

### Evening Handoff (~10 min)
```
1. Review what agents completed
2. Approve what's ready for next phase
3. Clear decision queue
4. Set up tomorrow's work
```

### Async Between
Agents work while you:
- Think about strategy
- Talk to users
- Handle non-coding founder tasks
- Rest

## Decision Velocity

The solo founder's bottleneck is decisions. Maximize velocity:

### Batch Decisions
Don't context-switch for every small decision. Let them queue up:

```markdown
## Decision Queue

### Non-Blocking (decide by EOD)
- [ ] Use Redis or in-memory cache for sessions?
- [ ] Include user avatar in list view?

### Blocking (need decision to proceed)
- [ ] Approval to deploy auth changes to production
```

### Pre-Decide Categories
Reduce runtime decisions by setting upfront policies:

```markdown
## Standing Decisions

**Technology:**
- Use existing libraries over custom code
- Prefer established patterns over clever solutions

**UX:**
- Mobile-first, responsive second
- Simple over feature-rich for MVP

**Security:**
- Err on the side of caution
- No security shortcuts for speed
```

### Decision Templates
For common decisions, create templates agents can follow:

```markdown
When choosing between X and Y:
1. Prefer X if [condition]
2. Prefer Y if [condition]
3. Escalate if [condition]
```

---

## Work Package Management

### Keep It Small
Work packages should be:
- Shippable in 1-3 days of agent work
- Clear enough to not need daily check-ins
- Independent enough to parallelize

**Too big:** "Build user management" (weeks, many unknowns)
**Right size:** "Add password reset flow" (days, clear scope)

### Limit Work in Progress
You only have so much judgment bandwidth:
- 2-3 active work packages max
- 1 package in each phase is ideal
- Finishing > starting

### Trust the Auto-Proceed
Once spec is approved, trust agents to execute:
```
Spec          → CHECKPOINT (you approve)
Design        → Auto-proceed
Backend       → Auto-proceed
Frontend      → Auto-proceed
QA            → Auto-proceed (flag if failures)
Security      → CHECKPOINT (you approve)
Ship          → CHECKPOINT (you press the button)
```

You don't need to be in every handoff. That's the whole point.

---

## When to Step In

### Always Step In
- Spec approval (before significant work)
- Security review (before ship)
- Ship decision (you push the button)
- Blocked packages (they need you)

### Consider Stepping In
- Architecture seems wrong
- You have a better idea
- Agent is going in circles
- Critical path needs your intuition

### Don't Step In
- Implementation is proceeding fine
- Small decisions within approved scope
- Style preferences (document conventions instead)
- Things that would be faster for agent to fix than explain

---

## The "Could Code" Advantage

You have an advantage over non-technical founders:

### You Catch Problems Early
You read the code. You see the architecture. You spot issues before they compound.

### You Make Better Trade-offs
"This is over-engineered for MVP" or "This needs more robustness" — you know when to say which.

### You Can Jump In When Needed
When something is genuinely faster to fix than explain, you fix it.

### You Understand What You're Approving
Checkpoints are meaningful because you actually review the work.

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Micro-Managing Agents
**Symptom:** Reviewing every commit, commenting on style, checking in constantly
**Fix:** Set conventions upfront, checkpoint at phases, trust the process

### Never Building
**Symptom:** Always orchestrating, never touching code, losing technical edge
**Fix:** Keep Builder Mode in rotation, stay hands-on for complex work

### Always Building
**Symptom:** Doing everything yourself, agents idle, bottlenecked on your time
**Fix:** That's not leverage — let agents handle what they can handle

### Approval Bottleneck
**Symptom:** Work packages stuck in checkpoint, agents waiting on you
**Fix:** Time-box reviews, clear the queue daily, delegate more to auto-proceed

### Scattered Focus
**Symptom:** Too many packages active, context-switching constantly
**Fix:** Limit WIP, finish before starting, focus on one thing at a time

---

## The Daily Reality

**You wake up.** Check _AGENTS.md. Package A shipped overnight (auto-deployed). Package B is in QA with one minor issue noted. Package C needs your spec approval.

**Morning.** You approve Package C spec, quickly review Package B's issue (minor, agent can fix), then spend an hour architecting Package D — a complex feature only you fully understand.

**Midday.** You do user interviews. (Founder work that's not coding.)

**Afternoon.** Builder mode. You implement the tricky part of Package D that requires deep context. Document it for agents to build around.

**Evening.** Package B fixed and ready to ship. You approve. Package C backend is done, frontend starting. Package D spec is drafted by PM agent, you refine it. Set up tomorrow.

**Total coding time:** 1-2 hours
**Packages progressing:** 4
**Decisions made:** ~10
**Shipped:** 1

That's the leverage.

## Summary

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Four Modes** | Architect, Builder, Reviewer, Orchestrator |
| **Leverage** | Your judgment at scale, not your typing |
| **Decision Velocity** | Batch, pre-decide, template |
| **WIP Limits** | 2-3 packages, finish > start |
| **The Advantage** | You could code, so you understand what you're directing |

**The goal:** Ship like a team of 12, with the judgment of one technical founder who knows when to direct, when to review, and when to build.
