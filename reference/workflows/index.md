# Workflows

Standard protocols that agents execute when triggered.

---

## Available Workflows

| Trigger | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `wrap` | Close out work — document, commit, clean up, verify |
| `status` | Quick overview of current state |
| `today` | Morning briefing — what needs attention |

---

## How They Work

Workflows are triggered by simple words or phrases. When the user says the trigger word, the agent executes the full protocol.

Example:
```
You: wrap

Agent: [executes full wrap protocol]
```
